# PyGoL
A pygame implementation of Conway's Game of Life, the cellular automaton. Includes the following functionality:
1. Defineable play area and resolution (number of cells)
2. Play and pause via spacebar
3. Step through simulation forward and backward (while paused) via left and right arrow keys
4. "Random" button creates a (pseudo-)random soup of cells (while paused)
5. "Clear" button erases the grid state (while paused)
6. Cursor left-click places a live cell (paused or palying)
7. Grid is wrapped horizontically and vertically, creating a toroidal topology
