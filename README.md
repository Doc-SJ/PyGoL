# PyGoL
A pygame implementation of Conway's Game of Life, the cellular automaton.
 It has play/pause and step-forward/(limited-)step-backward functionality through the spacebar and arrow keys respectively, place-live-cell functionality by the cursor, and a button which generates a (pseudo-)random soup.
